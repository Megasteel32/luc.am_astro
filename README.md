# Hello!
## Welcome to the repository for my personal website, [luc.am](https://luc.am)

This is the source for my little corner on the internet,
I strive for simplicity and easy of use (and totally not cause
I don't know shit about web development). The goal is to have everything
written in Markdown, then later converted to plain HTML using a static site generator.

I decided to use Astro for this, as it doesn't lock me into any one framework
(originally I was going to go with Hugo or the like) and it doesn't lock me into
any one format for my pages. Originally this website was hand written in HTML
and proudly used no CSS (again because I didn't know how to), and a secondary goal
was retaining the exact barebones look. 

My personal website is really a digital extension of myself. I'm not old enough
to have used MySpace, but I think it really captures the zeitgeist of the early internet
shortly before the golden age and then corporatization. 
Some of this magic has been recaptured, but either requires using a shitty WYSIWYG
website builder or extensive knowledge in web development. See [Rhyme Kickflip's site](https://www.shittykickflips.dog/) 
for a great example on both website design/implementation (there's like 0 shitty javascript)
and ideology. Maybe one day I'll implement CSS like she did, who knows. 

So yeah, the reason this website is good is that it's mine. And that's why yours is too!
Increasingly our only online presence (something which is practically required today)
is limited to centrally controlled media platforms. Sure there are decentralized options,
but even as someone who *could* use these options they're not 
mainstream enough for wide adoption. And frankly, the best kind of decentralized social media
is going outside and talking to people.

The internet should be a place to host your thoughts and ideas,
and to meet new people. It shouldn't be *the* place to do everything,
importantly being around people. We need physical spaces, and this drive to 
produce "content" and have all interaction online limits that. I'm part of 
the first generation to grow up with the internet in our pockets, and I've seen the 
damage social media has done to my peers and myself. Our parents were right, it was that damn phone.

With my personal website I hope to be part of a growing movement to change that. There are no ads,
no intentional tracking (I have analytics enabled but that's all on cloudflares end). As usual, all code
is open source (according to my definition that is, for non-commercial use). There's no AI generated
text or image content. So yeah, I hope you enjoy your stay, and maybe you'll be inspired to make your own. Peace.
